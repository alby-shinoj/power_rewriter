Directory Traversal: The program uses os.walk() to traverse the directory and its subdirectories.

File Renaming: It renames files and directories based on the user's input.

Content Replacement:

For each file, it reads the content.

Replaces the specified word (old_word) with the new word (new_word).

Writes the modified content back to the file.

Error Handling: If a file cannot be processed (e.g., due to encoding issues), it catches the exception and prints an error message.
